Programs utilizing different data structures - for science
---------------------------------------------------------
Project Structure - 
Separate projects by data structures each.
each project will have 3 levels
easy - brute force / basic syntax 
medium - slight improvements
advanced - more optimizations 

Post project commentary on things I learned, why the program is written this way, etc.
